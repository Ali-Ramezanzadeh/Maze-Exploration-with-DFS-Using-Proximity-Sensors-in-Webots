# Maze-Exploration-with-DFS-Using-Proximity-Sensors-in-Webots
This project features a simulated e-Puck robot navigating a maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Built in Webots, the robot explores and maps the maze using only proximity sensors â€” with no GPS or Lidar. It detects walls, makes directional decisions, and builds a schematic map of the maze during traversal.
